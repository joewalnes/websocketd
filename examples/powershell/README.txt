This examples directory shows some examples written in PowerShell.

On Windows, note that each .ps1 file also requires a .cmd file to launch it.
The WebSocket should connect to ws://..../[example].cmd.
On Linux this is not required due to the shebang (#!/usr/bin/env pwsh).

You can also test the command files by running from the command line.
