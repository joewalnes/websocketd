Release scripts for websocketd
==============================

Perform a fully automated repeatable release of websocketd. Including:

*   Downloading the correct version of Go
*   Cross-compiling Go for all required platforms
*   Inferring the next websocketd release version
*   Cross-compiling websocketd for all required platforms
*   Uploading releases to http://download.websocketd.com/
*   Git tagging the version

The release process has been built and test on Ubuntu.

Pre-reqs:

    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386 s3cmd git mercurial
    s3cmd --configure  # Setup Amazon S3 credentials

The actual Go release will be downloaded and cross-compiled. All compilation
occurs in an isolated environment to ensure there are no conflicts with any
system install Go. The first build will be really slow (cross compiling Go core),
but subsequent builds are incremental.

To build the packages for all platforms:

    make build

To perform a release to http://download.websocketd.com/
(version number will be automatically determined based on last git tag):

    make

To clean up:

    make clean
