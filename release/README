Release scripts for websocketd
==============================

Perform a fully automated repeateable release of websocketd. Including:

*   Downloading the correct version of Go
*   Cross-compiling Go for all required platforms
*   Cross-compiling websocketd for all required platforms
*   Uploading releases to http://download.websocketd.com/

The release process has been built and test on Ubuntu.

Pre-reqs:

    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386 s3cmd git mercurial
    s3cmd --configure  # Setup Amazon S3 credentials

The actual Go release will be downloaded and cross-compiled. All compilation
occurs in an isolated environment to ensure there are no conflicts with any
system install Go. The first build will be really slow (cross compiling Go core),
but subsequent builds are incremental.

To build the packages for all platforms:

    make

To upload to http://download.websocketd.com/ as version 1.2.3.4

    make RELEASE_VERSION=1.2.3.4 upload

To clean up:

    make clean
